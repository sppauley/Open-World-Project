The Unbroken Thread is a tactical RPG featuring a unique open world, a stagger and poise system adapted from games like Elden Ring, and a remix of the traditional Fire Emblem stat and equipment system.

[TITLE SCREEN]

The continent of Aeolia contains over 50 unique roaming and combat chapters that can be accessed in a free-form order. Cohesive zones with unique Ruler bosses present an exciting array of challenges, while a wide variety of weapons and accessories can be found to enhance your capabilities. In combat, use stagger damage when attacking to break an enemy's poise, then follow up with a guaranteed critical strike for massive damage. An array of recruitable characters have unique loyalty missions to expand their personal stories along with the game's world.

Maps in The Unbroken Thread can be challenged in any order, therefore, the player can easily choose to tackle harder maps earlier, for greater rewards, or play it safe and calmly train up their army and acquire new skills and items to open up new avenues of challenging lategame maps.

/** Gameplay

**Open World**

The Unbroken Thread's continent can be explored at the player's discretion. A variety of aesthetically and mechanically distinct zones hold secrets, rewards, and storylines for the player to discover.

**Stagger and Poise**

Weapons have a unique stagger damage value, which damages the poise of an enemy when attacking them. If a unit's stagger falls to 0 they are stunned for one turn and susceptible to a guaranteed critical follow-up attack. 

**New Stat System**

Powerful weapons and materials to improve their different attributes can be found throughout the game's world. Improving characters' damage and stagger is tied to finding new weapons and upgrading them at the forge. The Unbroken Thread removes defense, resistance, and damage boosting stats to keep progression focused on equipping more interesting and unique weapons and accessories.

**Loyalty Missions**

Bonding with recruited characters unlocks unique loyalty missions. Completing a character's loyalty mission grants them a powerful new skill or weapon, along with whatever else you might find during the battle.

**Varied Objectives**

Map objectives range from defeating multiple bosses in a short window, recovering library books, and escaping to breaking into treasure vaults and winning a race.

An easily accessible hub world allows your followers to mingle freely, getting to know each other, and themselves, better.
