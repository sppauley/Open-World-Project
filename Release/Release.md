Cohesive zones with unique Ruler bosses present an exciting array of challenges, while a wide variety of weapons and accessories can be found to enhance your capabilities.

The difficulty is easily adjustable via player choice. There is always a variety of difficulty in the chapters available, allowing players to seamlessly adjust the level of challenge they're facing.
